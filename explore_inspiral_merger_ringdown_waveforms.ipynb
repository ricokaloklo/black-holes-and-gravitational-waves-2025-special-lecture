Instead, it is sufficient to use corrections to the Newtonian gravity theory to model the dynamics of the binary system. One such technique is known as the **Post-Newtonian Approximation**. With the PN approximation scheme, analytical solutions to the two-body motion can still be written, allowing us to also write down analytical waveforms.\n",
